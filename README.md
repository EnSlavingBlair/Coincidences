skymap.py goes through a list of GW-type skymaps and compares them in a method following that outlined by Ashton et al 2018, https://doi.org/10.3847/1538-4357/aabfd2, which follows a Bayesian methodology.

distances.py takes the distance distribution of a GW event and that of its host galaxy (if known), and determines the significance of the two distances following a Bayesian methodology. This is currently a work-in-progress and is not complete.
